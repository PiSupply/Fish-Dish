The Fish Dish add-on board for the Raspberry Pi comes supplied as a kit with the following components:

* 2x13 Way GPIO Header
* 3x LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow)
* Buzzer
* Push button switch

You will be required to solder the components to the PCB and must have basic level of soldering skills in order to do this. All the parts are through hole and should be soldered in the correct orientation according to the + & - symbols on the PCB.

**NOTE:** If you are unsure on how to solder then please seek advice from someone who knows how to solder. Most Makerspace/Hackspace and similar community clubs will be able to assist.
